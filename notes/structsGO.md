There exists something called table driven tests, where you create test cases that the program will automatically run. 

By default, VSCode does it by generating a slice of anonymous structs {basically a datastructure made with no specific name to it, only such that it can be used locally}. Technically you have more freedom in how you do it, but this is a very neat way of doing it.
